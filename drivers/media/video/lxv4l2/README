INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required binary packages:
    none

To build 2.6.11 lxv4l2:
***********************
It is simplest to do this on the target system, if a developement
enviroment is available.  When cross compiling from a 32-bit x86
host, do not run step 4, but manually copy the .ko file to the
target the appropriate /lib/modules/ subdirectory on the target.

After unpacking the tarball which contain the files listed above
  in a plain directory, run:
  1. autoconf  (builds .configure)
  2. ./configure --with-kernel-path= "your path to the kernel sources"
  3. make EXTRA_CFLAGS=" -DLINUX_2_6=1"
  4. make EXTRA_CFLAGS=" -DLINUX_2_6=1" install

Note: the driver module lxv4l2.o must be copied to the target system and
  installed with insmod.  The load can be automatic if the driver is
  copied to /lib/modules/<kernel_version>/drivers/video/media and the
  file /etc/modules.conf is updated to contain the line
  alias char-major-81-0 lxv4l2
  If the driver is installed in /lib/modules, depmod -a should be run
  prior to booting the system.
